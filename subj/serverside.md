# About
This directory is to be left on the server. Make sure to adapt the `pslides.phpSubjPath` in main.js file according to the directory in which you store the PHP scripts concerned with storing particpant data.

Currently, data are organized so that there is a user > projects > app > all experiment files. When data get stored, they end up in the user's path.
If you have your own server, then simply create a directory `/u/<my-initials>/<my-project-name>/app/` and fill it up with all experiment files (HTML, CSS, stimuli and so on).
